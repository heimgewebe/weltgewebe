# Weltgewebe OS Convergence Adapter

## Purpose

`scripts/convergence/weltgewebe_convergence_adapter.py` is a local read-only adapter from a versioned Weltgewebe input profile to the public konvergenzregelkreis `Assessment Request v1`.

The pinned public protocol head is:

```text
83ed435bf9eb490e81a6ff2103b6c1397440d40b
```

The input profile and adapter envelope carry that `protocol_head`. The emitted request does not. A public request remains the exact protocol object with `schema_version: 1`, `risk_level: R0|R1|R2|R3`, `observation`, `classification`, `effects`, `verifications` and optional `closure`.

## Contract Surface

The only local schema truth is:

- `contracts/convergence/v1.0.0/assessment-profile.schema.json`

No local request schema is authoritative. The request shape is owned by the public `heimgewebe/konvergenzregelkreis` repository, specifically `protocol/assessment-request.v1.schema.json`, its referenced receipt schemas and `profiles/R2.v1.json` at the pinned head above. The adapter nevertheless contains an explicit defensive mirror of that pinned v1 surface: exact nested keys, enums, cardinalities, schema-declared uniqueness, RFC 3339 timestamps, integer schema versions, finite JSON values and the pinned R2 evidence requirements. This executable mirror is compatibility and supply-chain guard code, not a second protocol authority. CI checks every mirrored key and enum set against an exact detached checkout of the pinned public commit and then runs the protocol-owned evaluator. Evaluator acceptance remains decisive.

The deterministic terminal conformance fixtures are:

- `contracts/convergence/v1.0.0/fixtures/conformance.terminal.profile.json`

The pure public request is derived from the `request` property within the profile. No redundant terminal request fixture is maintained.


## Threat Model and Trust Boundaries

The adapter operates in a zero-trust external environment. It validates SHA-256 values only as lowercase 64-character hexadecimal strings. As a read-only and reference-only component, it does not fetch referenced objects and cannot recompute whether a digest matches external content.

A compromised adapter could emit an internally consistent but false request or envelope. The public evaluator checks protocol shape and assessment semantics; it does not, by itself, authenticate every external URL or receipt. Operational trust therefore requires both evaluator acceptance and independent verification of referenced commits, receipts, sources, and their digests.

The exact 40-character Git object id and `git fsck --strict` bind CI to one commit object and validate repository structure. They do not prove who signed or authored that commit. `git verify-commit` becomes meaningful only after a trusted signing identity and key policy are defined.

For a later protocol release, add a new versioned contract directory, pin its protocol head, update the defensive mirror and fixtures, and run old and new evaluator contracts in parallel during migration. Do not silently retarget the existing `v1.0.0` pin.

## Authority Boundary


Profile paths provided as symlinks are explicitly rejected. This design choice reduces local path confusion and accidental referencing of incorrect profiles. It is not intended as a general host filesystem security mechanism.

The adapter has exactly these local effects:

- parse a local profile file up to a fail-closed 1 MiB input limit;
- reject duplicate JSON keys, non-finite JSON constants and forbidden embedded payload keys;
- canonicalize an in-memory public Assessment Request v1;
- compute a SHA-256 digest over canonical request JSON;
- print the selected output to stdout.

The adapter must not call Bureau, Chronik, Grabowski, GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes or production services. It must not write receipts, update task state, append event history, deploy, roll back or mark acceptance. A successful adapter run is only a local request-building proof. The profile and intent digests bind the bytes used for request construction, but they do not authenticate an author. Provenance is established externally by the hash-bound Grabowski execution receipt.

## Reference Boundary

The input profile may model objective, desired state, observed state, deviation, decision and rollback in domain-neutral text. It must not copy Bureau task payloads, Chronik histories, Grabowski receipt bodies or Weltgewebe domain objects.

The public request carries external truth only as protocol references and digests:

- Bureau task authority is mapped into `observation.source_refs` and `closure.bureau_task_ref`.
- Chronik event evidence is mapped into `observation.source_refs` and `closure.chronik_event_ref`.
- Grabowski live receipt evidence is mapped into `observation.source_refs`, verification evidence and closure cleanup evidence.
- The exact Weltgewebe commit or deploy receipt is mapped into `observation.source_refs` and `effects`.

## Rollback And Negative Control

Rollback is not executed by this adapter. Rollback is represented as:

- a passing `verification` with `kind: recovery`;
- closure cleanup evidence;
- a residual-risk reference that names the external rollback execution boundary.

Negative control is represented as a passing `verification` with `kind: negative_control`. The adapter rejects profiles that try to embed mutable external payloads or symbolic Git revisions in source references, effect and verification evidence, or closure references. This includes branch and tag shorthands, `refs/heads` and `refs/tags`, generic `.git` repository URLs without an exact commit binding, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket tree, blob, raw, archive and compare URLs, codeload URLs, query revisions and `.git#...` fragments. Exact 40-character commit URLs, exact GitHub pull-request identity URLs, and exact GitLab merge-request identity URLs remain valid references. Known public Git hosts require HTTPS and a complete allowlisted form: exact commit identity, commit-bound tree/blob/raw file, exact compare/archive/download, or exact PR/MR identity. Unrecognized suffixes, queries or fragments outside explicit commit-binding forms, trailing-dot and lookalike hosts, userinfo, explicit ports, percent-encoded path octets, repeated separators, backslashes, and path dot-segments are rejected. Generic external `.git` URLs accept only a complete HTTPS `?ref=<commit>`, `?at=<commit>`, or `#<commit>` end form without extra parameters or fragments. Neutral external evidence hosts are not classified as Git merely because a path contains `/pull/` or `/-/merge_requests/`; explicit Git markers remain commit-bound on every host.

## Evaluator Compatibility

The regression test `scripts/ci/tests/test_convergence_adapter_contract.py` reads the protocol checkout from `KONVERGENZREGELKREIS_ROOT`. CI creates that checkout in the runner's temporary directory, fetches only the exact commit `83ed435bf9eb490e81a6ff2103b6c1397440d40b`, verifies `HEAD`, and treats a missing or different checkout as failure. Local protocol-integration runs require an explicit `KONVERGENZREGELKREIS_ROOT`; without it, those integration cases are skipped while repository-local validation and safety tests remain independently runnable. CI always supplies the explicit temporary checkout at the pinned commit.

The mirror test compares the adapter's request keys, nested receipt keys, enums and R2 requirements directly with the pinned schemas and profile. The positive request must then evaluate to `terminally_closed` under the public R2 profile. A request missing required evidence must block with `evidence_missing`. A request with conflicting receipt hashes must block with `conflicting_evidence`. A request with adapter metadata such as `protocol_head` at top level must be rejected by the public request schema.

## Profile and Request Constraints

The `profile_id` is restricted to 128 characters as a local operational bound: identifiers remain manageable in logs, envelopes, filenames, and external references while retaining ample space for descriptive uniqueness. This limit is not a claim about Bureau or Chronik storage limits.

## CLI Shape

Inspect the command surface:

```sh
python3 scripts/convergence/weltgewebe_convergence_adapter.py --help
```

The help output names the required profile path and the three output modes `envelope`, `request`, and `hash`. Default output is an adapter envelope:

```sh
python3 scripts/convergence/weltgewebe_convergence_adapter.py PROFILE.json
```

Abbreviated output shape:

```json
{
  "adapter": "weltgewebe-os-convergence-adapter",
  "protocol_head": "83ed435bf9eb490e81a6ff2103b6c1397440d40b",
  "request": {"schema_version": 1, "...": "..."},
  "request_sha256": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  "profile_sha256": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  "intent_sha256": "<64 lowercase hex characters>"
}
```

The envelope contains adapter metadata, `protocol_head`, the pure public request, `request_sha256`, `profile_sha256` and a separate `intent_sha256`. It intentionally contains no generated-at timestamp: identical input must produce identical output. Freshness and replay decisions belong to the request's `observation.observed_at`, the referenced receipts and the external evaluator; an adapter-local clock field would not provide replay protection.

For the request alone:

```sh
python3 scripts/convergence/weltgewebe_convergence_adapter.py PROFILE.json --output request
```

For the request hash alone:

```sh
python3 scripts/convergence/weltgewebe_convergence_adapter.py PROFILE.json --output hash
```

Live acceptance is outside this repository-local adapter. The public evaluator or installed acceptance command is the only authority for transition assessment.

## Synthetic fixture safety

`conformance.terminal.profile.json` is protocol-conformant test data, not a live T013 receipt. It sets `evidence_mode: synthetic_fixture`; every evidence reference starts with `fixture:` and the observation explicitly states that it establishes no live evidence, deployment acceptance, Bureau closure, Chronik import, or Grabowski execution.

A real acceptance profile must set `evidence_mode: live`. The adapter rejects `fixture:` references in live mode and rejects non-fixture references in synthetic mode. This prevents a terminal conformance fixture from being reused as operational closure evidence.
