## Required runtime artifacts

Production deploys assume the following runtime artifacts exist.

Always required:

- `policies/limits.yaml`

Conditionally required (when the frontend is deployed):

- `apps/web/build/index.html`
- `apps/web/build/_app`

## Preflight guard

`scripts/weltgewebe-up` runs `scripts/preflight/runtime_contract.sh` before `docker compose up`.

The guard validates required artifacts and aborts the deployment early if mandatory runtime contracts are violated.
