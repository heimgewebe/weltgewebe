# Report Lifecycle Inventory

Generated automatically. Do not edit manually.
This inventory is descriptive only. Absent core lifecycle metadata is expected at this stage and is not a policy judgement.
Primary references are exact path matches in canonical documentation surfaces. Derived generated references are reported separately.

### Overlap Justifications

| Surface | Related surface | Distinction / consumer justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| docs/_generated/agent-readiness.md | docs/_generated/claim-evidence-map.md | `docs/claims/README.md` uses evidence links; readiness is a separate execution gate. |
| docs/_generated/architecture-drift.md | docs/_generated/staleness-report.md | `docs/policies/architecture-critique.md` uses structural drift, not review-age status. |
| docs/_generated/backlinks.md | docs/_generated/doc-index.md | `scripts/ci/fixtures/repoground_vertical_pilot.v1.json` tests lookup direction. |
| docs/_generated/backlinks.md | docs/_generated/supersession-map.md | `scripts/ci/fixtures/repoground_vertical_pilot.v1.json` tests backlink edge types. |
| docs/_generated/change-resonance.md | docs/_generated/implicit-dependencies.md | `.github/workflows/docs-guard.yml` checks declared impact apart from inferred dependencies. |
| docs/_generated/doc-coverage.md | docs/_generated/orphans.md | `audit/impl-registry.yaml` uses metadata coverage; orphan checks stay relation-based. |
| docs/_generated/impl-index.md | docs/_generated/system-map.md | `architecture/blueprint.docmeta-engine.md` uses the map; the index remains a path list. |
| docs/_generated/implicit-dependencies.md | docs/_generated/knowledge-gaps.md | `.github/workflows/docs-guard.yml` checks inferred edges apart from missing knowledge. |
| docs/_generated/relates-to-audit.md | docs/_generated/relations-analysis.md | `scripts/ci/fixtures/repoground_vertical_pilot.v1.json` tests relation scopes. |
| docs/_generated/report-lifecycle-inventory.md | docs/_generated/report-lifecycle.md | `docs/process/report-lifecycle.md` uses inventory; alignment uses compliance findings. |
