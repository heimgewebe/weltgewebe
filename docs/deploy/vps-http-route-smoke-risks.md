# VPS HTTP Route Smoke Risks

Route-only evidence is narrower than runtime evidence. This file names the main risks so the receipt cannot silently inflate a route proof into a deploy proof.

| Risk class | Failure mode | Control | If ignored |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evidence inflation | A route-only pass is reported as API readiness or deploy success. | Receipt must state `route-only` and `real API readiness remains unproven`. | The team may close a runtime issue without having started the real API safely. |
| Hidden database mutation | A smoke retry starts the configured production API and triggers startup migrations. | Route-only boundary forbids production API start. A separate migration-safe runtime smoke may start the real API only with `WELTGEWEBE_API_STARTUP_MIGRATIONS=verify-applied` or a separately approved migration window. | A supposedly read-only/no-migration operation mutates the database. |
| Frontend/CSP blind spot | The route smoke does not serve the frontend app and therefore proves no frontend build or CSP behavior. | Runbook forbids frontend/CSP readiness claims. | A blank page or asset failure may be missed until later cutover checks. |
| Upstream blind spot | Static route checks can show that `/api/*` points toward an upstream, but not that the upstream works. | `/api/health/ready` from the real API remains a separate runtime gate; `verify-applied` proves migration history parity, not full app behavior. | Proxy shape is mistaken for application health. |
| DNS/ACME confusion | HTTP-only route evidence is mistaken for public DNS or HTTPS readiness. | Explicitly forbid DNS, INWX, HTTPS, and ACME claims. | Public cutover may be attempted without resolver/certificate evidence. |
| Drift between config and runtime | The documented route-only surface may diverge from `infra/caddy/Caddyfile.http-smoke`. | Static test checks the route surface and no-frontend/no-TLS boundary. | Documentation stays green while Caddy behavior changes. |
| Compose override drift | `infra/compose/compose.vps.override.yml` stops exposing `WELTGEWEBE_CADDYFILE`, or the route-only run forgets to select `../caddy/Caddyfile.http-smoke`. | Static guard checks the override selection hook and the runbook requires an explicit Caddyfile selection receipt. | A supposed route-only smoke may use the production Caddyfile or a stale path. |
| Synthetic-upstream overclaim | A later harness with a fake upstream proves forwarding mechanics but not the Rust API. | Synthetic upstream receipts must say `not real API readiness`. | Fake 200 responses mask real application startup failures. |
| Port collision / bind failure | Local or container port binding fails or attaches to the wrong listener. | Treat bind ambiguity as failed/blocked and do not stop or replace unrelated services without a separate approval. | The receipt may describe another process, or a repair attempt may disturb production routing. |
| Resource exhaustion | A supposedly small harness consumes CPU, memory, file descriptors, disk, or container slots on `wg-prod-1`. | Keep route-only checks bounded; prefer static inspection when runtime proof is not allowed. | A diagnostic operation degrades the target host without proving API readiness. |
| Logging/observability blind spot | The route-only proof lacks enough logs to tell selected config, listener, host header, and upstream mode apart. | Receipt must record the selected Caddyfile, route-only mode, and whether any upstream was synthetic. | Later reviewers cannot distinguish safe evidence from an accidental runtime smoke. |
| Host-header/header drift | Host-header, trusted-proxy, or forwarded-header behavior differs between the harness and production path. | Keep claims limited to the exact host-header/config surface tested and require a later runtime smoke for proxy/header readiness. | A local 200 may hide production request-shape failures. |

## Practical interpretation

The route-only smoke is a map-reading exercise, not a crossing of the river. Useful: yes. Sufficient for deploy: no. The bridge toll is still paid at the live API/runtime gate.
